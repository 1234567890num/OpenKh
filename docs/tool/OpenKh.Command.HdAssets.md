# OpenKh.Command.HdAssets

Extract [HD assets](../common/hdassets.md) from PS4 unpacked data.

## How to use

Just place the executable in the game directory and open it.

## Arguments

As argument, a single file or a directory can be specified. When a directory is specified, every file of every subfolder will be extracted. Without arguments, it will just consider the directory where the executable is called.

## Additional info

Apparently the file `arc/menu/01_race.arc` from Birth By Sleep is corrupt and unreadable. It is unknown if the remastered actually uses that file; and if yes, how.
