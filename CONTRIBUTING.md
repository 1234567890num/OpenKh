# Contributing to OpenKH

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenKH!

The project involves code and documentation. There is no need for you to have coding skills, as the documentation has a lot of room for improvements too!

## Ask questions

Asking is the most important part when it comes to helping the project. If there is any aspect that you would like to help improve, feel free to discuss it openly!

There are multiple ways to open a discussion. You can [open a new issue](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/OpenKh/issues/new) or [join to our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MgTaQgf). There is even a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xUMpsGBE/openkh) showing an organized list of objectives that need to be worked on, have been completed, or are currently being worked on.

## Bug report

To report bugs and errors, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/OpenKh/issues/new) and specify the steps to reproduce the bug, including the stack trace, messages, and the files that the tools or libraries were trying to open.

## Feature request

To request a feature, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/OpenKh/issues/new) detailing your request. This can be anything from optimizations to new features.

## Code guideline

[This](CODE_GUIDELINE.md) is a document that gives an idea on the code requirements to have your content merged into the master branch. For the most part, as long as the code works as intended and can be cleaned up later if needed, it's more than welcome!

## Documents contribution

Documentation is really important, since it is what everyone (including non-coders) can read and understand. It includes every technical research done for all the games in the series, like file formats, differences between each version of the game, unused content, how to use the libraries, tools, or modding tutorials. RAM hacking content is more than welcome too.
