## BAR Editor
BAR editor allows you to open BAR format files, used as file container.
It is possible to modify the existing content, removing adding or replacing the files inside.
The BAR editor is capable of being used as a hub where it is possible to launch other editors and make changes on the fly without the hassle of extracting and reimporting individual components.
