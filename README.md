## BAR Editor
BAR editor allows you to open BAR format files, used as file container.
It is possible to modify the existing content, removing adding or replacing the files inside.
The BAR editor can be used as a hub too, where it is possible to launch other editors from it and made changes at fly without to extract and import the data back.
