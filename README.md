This is a project aiming to centralize all the technical knowledge of the 'Kingdom Hearts' game series in one place, providing documentation, tools, code libraries, and the foundation for modding the commercial games.

## Documentation

All the documentation is located in the `/docs` folder in its raw form. A more web-friendly version can be accessed at: https://openkh.dev/

## Downloads

New builds of OpenKH are generated every time a contributor makes changes. There is a continuous integration system where it is possible to download the latest artifacts (or build version) of the entire project.
